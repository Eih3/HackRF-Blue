#HackRF Blue
The HackRF Blue project aims to reduce the cost and increase access to full-featured SDR.

In the BOM you will find notes about individual parts. Some parts can safely be replaced with Chinese parts, others cannot. 

If you would like to use the same PCB and Assembly house that produce the HackRF Blue, their contact details are as follows:

<h3>When costing the project, keep in mind the following:</h3>
<p>1. There will be a certain percentage of boards that will not work after manufacturing, in our case the number was 30%. About 3% will not power up at all, another 3% will not enter DFU mode, and about 20-25% will have poor RF performance due to cold solder or other issues. These boards will need to be reworked by hand. You cannot rely on factory staff to be able to diagnose and rework something like a HackRF unless you use a very experienced (and expensive) manufacturer. In our case, I reworked the boards myself and educated the factory staff on the process. If you are lucky, this experience will help reduce your costs.</p>
<p>2. The BOM here does not include headers, SMA connectors, or RF shielding. These should be costed sepairately as different people want different combinations.</p>
<p>3. It is very inadvisable to embark on a manufacturing project as complicated as the HackRF if you haven't built a board yourself because when you have a factory full of staff and limited time on the SMT machine you need to be able to think fast and solve any problems very quickly under considerable pressure, in other words you need to have an intimate understanding of how the HackRF works.</p>
<p>4. It is very important that you factor the MSL level of various parts into the manufacturing process. For example if you open MSL3 parts to produce a sample board, and those parts are in tape, you can't use them for production a week later.</p>

If you would like some PCBs to build your own board, contact me (garethhayes.net). I have a limited number left, if I think you might be able to pull off a manufacturing run I'll give you some.
